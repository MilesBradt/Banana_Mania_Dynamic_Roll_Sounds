Special thanks to Dead Line for sending me examples, original sound effects to use, and feedback on how to make this as close to 1:1 as possible. 
Go check out their Classic Sound Pack and other mods they've made!

Another special thanks to MorsGames for their Banana Mod Manager, this wouldn't be possible otherwise!
